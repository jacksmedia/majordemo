aboutMe:
  name: Alexander Jacks
  title: JavaScript Dev and AWS Certified IaaS specialist
  bio: Deep experience in web architectures with a TS DoD networking background. Psych degree, AWS cert, open source & DAO enthusiast.
  long_summary_title: Technical Expertise
  long_summary: I can build websites and PWAs (progressive web apps) using some of these technologies, in no particular order-- AWS (Amplify, Lambdas, Cloudfront), Azure Functions, nodeJS, JSX, Markdown, ReactJS, VueJS, CSS3, HTML5, PHP, Sketch, Photoshop, SSGs, CI/CD, Gatsby, WordPress, Shopify, Gridsome, Docusaurus. Lose time when I work with colors and gradients; enjoy both copywriting and infrastructure debugging. Discovered Ethereum in 2017 and after it helped pay for my honeymoon I haven't felt the same about digital records nor currencies ever since. Began hacking PC games in the 1990s, still emulating ancient hardware for fun.
